# Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This simple react.js application was created in order to demonstrate how JWTs can securely be utilized by an SPA. It is the front end component of celbert96/TSAuthServer, a basic auth server written in Typescript. 

When the user logs in, the SPA makes an HTTP request to an authentication endpoint on the auth server. If authentication is successful, the auth server mints a JWT and creates a sessionToken cookie to store that JWT. Information about the JWT (expiration datetime, etc) is provided in the response body. This sessionToken cookie is set to HTTP Only, meaning the SPA doesn't have direct access to the token. Because the SPA cannot access the token directly, it must rely on and store the information provided in the response body of the authentication call. Because those values are stored on the client they can be tampered with - however they are only there to provide a better user experience. The source of truth for all authorization checks server side is the JWT stored in the sessionToken cookie.

NOTE: This application just serves as a proof of concept/exercise and is not production ready. For example, there is no refresh token provided to the client, so once a JWT is provided there is no way to request a new one - it will simply expire after the expiration datetime and the user will be logged out. This is not a good user experience.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
